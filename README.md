# Collection of Basic .NET Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly .NET projects built with C# to practice core programming concepts and application structures. Each project explores a specific topic or challenge, ranging from simple console applications to form-based interfaces and data-handling exercises. Together, these projects illustrate my growing fluency in .NET development, offering practical examples of object-oriented programming, user interaction, and problem-solving within the .NET framework.
